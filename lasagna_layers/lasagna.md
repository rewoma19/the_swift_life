# Instructions

In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book. You have four tasks, all related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

## Task 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

Define the **expectedMinutesInOven** constant, that stores how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40:

    expectedMinutesInOven
    // Returns 40

## Task 2: Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

Define the function **remainingMinutesInOven(elapsedMinutes:)** that takes the argument **elapsedMinutes** which holds the number of minutes the lasagna has already been in the oven. The function should return how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the expected oven time in minutes from the previous task.

    remainingMinutesInOven(elapsedMinutes: 30)
    // Returns 10

## Task 3: Calculate the preparation time in minutes

Define the function **preparationTimeInMinutes(layers:)** that takes the arguments **layers** which holds the number of layers you added to the lasagna. The function should return how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare.
    
    preparationTimeInMinutes(layers: 2)
    // Returns 4
