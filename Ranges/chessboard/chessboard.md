#  Instructions

As a chess enthusiast, you want to write your own version of the game. Yes, there may be plenty of implementations of chess available online already, but yours will be unique!

You start with implementing a chess board.

The chess game will be played on an eight-square wide and eight-square wide and eight-square long board. The squares are identified by a letter and a number.

## 1. Define rank & file range

The game will have to store the ranks of the board. The ranks are the rows of the board, and are numbered from 1 to 8.

The game will also have to store the files on the board. The files are the board's columns and are identified by letters A to H.

Define the **ranks** and **files** constants that store the range of ranks and files respectively.

    ranks
    // Returns 1..8
    
    files 
    // Returns "A".."H"
