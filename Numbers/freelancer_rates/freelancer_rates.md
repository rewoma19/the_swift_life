# Instructions

In this exercise you will be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with their clients about the prices of certain projects. You will write a few utitlity functions to quickly calculate the costs for the clients.

## 1. Calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate

A client contacts the freelancer to enquire about their rates. The freelancer explains that they **work 8 hours a day.** However, the freelancer knows only their hourly rates for the project. Help them estimate a day rate given an hourly rate.

Implement the function **dailyRateFrom(hourlyRate:)**, that takes the argument **hourlyRate** which holds the freelancers hourly rate. The function should return the daily rate based on the hourly rate.
    
    dailyRateFrom(hourlyRate: 60)
    // Returns 480.0
    
The returned daily rate should be a **Double**.
